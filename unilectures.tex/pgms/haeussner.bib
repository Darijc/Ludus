@techreport{heckerman1995tutorial,
  abstract = {A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in conjunction with bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data. In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling approach using a real-world case study.},

  abstract = {Major depression constitutes a serious challenge in personal
and public health. Tens of millions of people each year suf-
fer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate
treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to
detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individu-
als. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of
Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical de-
pression, based on a standard psychometric instrument.
Through their social media postings over a year preceding
the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes re-
lating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguis-
tic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant med-
ications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a sta-
tistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of de-
pression, before the reported onset. We find that social me-
dia contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of
depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in
social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered
egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns,
and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe
our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools
for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by
healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling
those suffering from depression to be more proactive about
their mental health.
