bahia cocoa review 13 showers continued throughout the week in the bahia cocoa zone alleviating the drought since early january and improving prospects for the coming temporao although normal humidity levels have not been restored comissaria smith said in its weekly review the dry period means the temporao will be late this year arrivals for the week ended february 22 were 155 221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5 93 mln against 5 81 at the same stage last year again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures comissaria smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end with total bahia crop estimates around 6 4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6 2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers middlemen exporters and processors there are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining bahia superior certificates in view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment comissaria smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for march shipment at 1 750 to 1 780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named new crop sales were also light and all to open ports with june july going at 1 850 and 1 880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under new york july aug sept

traders say soviets made large sugar purchase 13 the soviet union bought almost 90 000 tonnes of raw sugar from international trade houses last night with some of the sugar changing hands at discounts to the spot may world sugar contract according to trade sources they said japanese trade houses sold up to three cargoes of thai sugar for relatively nearby delivery british and european based trade houses sold the remaining six cargoes for shipment between april may july they said traders said this week s sharp fall in world sugar prices helped to provoke the soviet union into covering nearby needs yesterday spot may sugar closed at 7 18 cents a pound reuter cocoa chairman works towards buffer compromise 13 international cocoa organization s icco council chairman denis bra kanon continued work towards a compromise plan on how the icco buffer stock should buy cocoa consumer delegates said consumer delegates said bra kanon had not formally presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers and it was unlikely he would do so before friday they said there was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding items could be reached by friday when the council session is due to end consumers said bra kanon completed bilateral consultations with several delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft buffer stock rules package they said certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount of non member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and forward material the delegates said the buffer stock working group finalized the remaining buffer stock rules with only minor modifications to the original draft buffer stock package produced last week the delegates said the icco council is due to elect a new executive director when it reconvenes friday producer delegates said producers intend to present a single candidate for the post and this is most likely to be edouard kouame from ivory coast they said earlier the existing executive director kobena erbynn from ghana was expected to re nominated but he is now likely to withdraw the delegates said the executive committee is due to meet friday at 1100 gmt with the council unlikely to reconvene until late friday consumers said reuter philippines to lobby u s for higher sugar quota 13 the philippines will ask the u s agriculture department usda to increase its 1987 sugar import quota following market reports that taiwan will not be able to fulfil its quota sugar regulation administration sra chairman arsenim yulo said yulo told reuters the sra would also protest a usda move to award taiwan s shortfall to the dominican republic the dominican republic already has a larger sugar quota yulo said any taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to the philippines or at the least we should share a hike with the dominican republic the usda last december listed 1987 sugar import quota allocations for the dominican republic at 160 160 short tons and for taiwan at 10 920 short tons the philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in its quota to 143 780 short tons from 231 660 in 1986 reuter united states lines lays off far east staff 13 lt united states lines inc has laid off 260 employees almost its entire far east staff its hong kong office general manager elliott burnside told reuters he also said calls by two of its container ships to busan south korea and kaohsiung taiwan had been cancelled he declined comment on local press reports that u s lines planned to suspend operations because of failure to restructure its 1 27 billion u s dlr debt but said the firm would make an announcement later today u s lines filed for protection from its creditors under chapter eleven of the u s federal law last november the english language south china morning post said u s lines decided yesterday to sell its two remaining transpacific service fleets and assets and those of its u s south america operation it quoted a letter by company s chief executive charles hiltzheimer that said the ships and assets will be bought by rival u s shipping companies subject to approval by their boards u s lines far east operations comprise offices in hong kong singapore manila busan seoul tokyo yokohama kobe and osaka burnside said reuter philippine sugar crop set at 1 6 mln tonnes 13 philippine sugar production in the 1987 88 crop year ending august has been set at 1 6 mln tonnes up from a provisional 1 3 mln tonnes this year sugar regulatory administration sra chairman arsenio yulo said yulo told reuters a survey during the current milling season which ends next month showed the 1986 87 estimate would almost certainly be met he said at least 1 2 mln tonnes of the 1987 88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption yulo said about 130 000 tonnes would be set aside for the u s sugar quota 150 000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50 000 tonnes would be sold on the world market he said if the government approved a long standing sra recommendation to manufacture ethanol the project would take up another 150 000 tonnes slightly raising the target the government for its own reasons has been delaying approval of the project but we expect it to come through by july yulo said ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos yulo said three major philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved the ethanol project would result in employment for about 100 000 people sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry production quotas set for the first time in 1987 88 had been submitted to president corazon aquino i think the president would rather wait till the new congress convenes after the may elections he said but there is really no need for such quotas we are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level the producers have never enjoyed such high prices yulo said adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul up from 190 pesos last august yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the sra s bid to control production we are no longer concerned so much with the world market he said adding producers in the negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production he said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry the brazilians long ago learnt their lessons yulo said they have 300 sugar mills compared with our 41 but they relocated many of them and diversified production we want to call this a sugarcane industry instead of the sugar industry he said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock used for thatching roofs or used in room panelling when you cut sugarcane you don t even have to produce sugar he said yulo said the philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the international sugar agreement which expired in 1984 as a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices yulo said if there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed particularly because the european community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets he said current world prices holding steady at about 7 60 cents per pound were uneconomical for the philippines where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound if the price holds steady for a while at 7 60 cents i expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year he said yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990 with world consumption outstripping production he said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup but we are not happy with the reagan administration he said since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the u s in 1982 when they restored the quota system they cut ours in half without any justification manila was keenly watching washington s moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents the u s agriculture department last december slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the philippines to 143 780 short tons from 231 660 short tons in 1986 yulo said despite next year s increased production target some philippine mills were expected to shut down at least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986 87 season he said we expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season reuter sugar market sees good recent offtake 13 reports the soviet union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30 40 points under new york may futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations traders said the soviet buying follows recent whites buying by india turkey and libya as well as possible raws offtake by china some 300 000 to 400 000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end buyer enquiry they added dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the soviet union in the past few days involved japanese operators selling thai origin sugar prices for nearby shipment thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good far eastern demand possibly for sales to the soviet union or to pre empt any large block enquiries by china they said thai prices for march may 15 shipments have hardened to around 13 14 points under may new york from larger discounts previously they added traders said the soviet union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes it is probable that some 1 8 mln tonnes have already been taken up they said turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100 000 tonnes of whites while india had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for mar apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more libya was also a buyer this week taking two cargoes of whites which for an undisclosed shipment period were reported priced around 229 230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight they added futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end buyer physicals offtake although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip traders said pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100 000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender originally scheduled for tomorrow might not take place until a week later egypt will be seeking 20 000 tonnes of may arrival white sugar next week while greece has called an internal ec tender for 40 000 tonnes of whites to be held in early april

final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by international cocoa organization icco council chairman denis bra kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members delegates said we are close nearer than ever to accepting it but we still have some work to do producer spokesman mama mohammed of ghana told reuters after a producers meeting european community ec delegates said ec consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted no problems in getting full consumer acceptance delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today the last day of the fortnight long council meeting they said the compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non icco member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases delegates said the non member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations the 15 pct figure up five percentage points from earlier proposals represents a concession to consumers delegates said they have demanded a larger allowance for non member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted another problem area delegates said was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him the compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed a move some delegates described as just fiddling but the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them delegates said the compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby intermediate or forward positions delegates said if the compromise is accepted by the council most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week or as soon as practically possible the full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 gmt to discuss the compromise and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied they said consumers are due to meet

council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure consumer delegates said the buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials under which ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to malaysian thus if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a malaysian price of 1 200 stg a tonne he would accept ghana offers up to 1 337 stg differentials were fixed as follows country differential stg tonne malaysia 0 brazil 55 ivory

the queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop an australian sugar producers association spokesman said the industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas notably in the burdekin and mackay regions he said from brisbane elsewhere in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern new south wales the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month he said the spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop which is harvested from around june to december he said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture such as mackay mean they really only need about three days of the region s heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane but rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas he said it s certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls he said reuter japanese shipyards to form cartel cut output 13 japan s ailing shipyards have won approval from the fair trade commission to form a cartel to slash production to about half of total capacity for one year effective april 1 industry sources said the approval follows an act of parliament passed

10 000 gross tonnes will limit newbuilding output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes in 1987 88 the shipbuilders association of japan said industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel in 1988 89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish last week s temporary act of parliament also allows shipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50 billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasing redundant land and equipment from shipbuilders the ministry will start drawing up its restructuring guidelines from april 1 and the yards will implement the guidelines from september industry sources said reuter ec commissioner

retire in june the company proposed that he be appointed life president and that current chief executive john gunn should take over as chairman b and c shares eased 11p to 459p at 1040 gmt reuter cocoa deal seen positive but no price guarantee 13 the buffer stock rules agreement reached on friday by the international cocoa organization icco is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices many icco delegates and trade sources said the accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 member icco council after two weeks of talks european chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long if the buffer stock operation is successful i doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices a european dealer said and if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically dealers said the buffer stock is the market regulating tool of the icco into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre set stabilization range a new cocoa agreement came into force in january but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time the new rules take effect immediately the buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market since prices are below the must buy level of 1 600 special drawing rights per tonne specified in the agreement the sources said the buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100 000 tonnes within a five week period but its approach will be more cautious buffer stock manager juergen plambeck said the buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 000 tonnes of cocoa 100 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock icco council chairman and ivorian agriculture minister denis bra kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices ivory coast is the world s largest cocoa producer we have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market bra kanon told reporters after the council adjourned bra kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94 000 tonnes estimated by the icco statistics committee however some producer and consumer members emerged from the final icco council meeting with reservations about the pact ghana whose high quality cocoa is the world s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country s export earnings made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa saying they were too high for ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock according to consumer spokesman peter baron of west germany consumers weren t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules we reached a very sensitive compromise there were no real winners or losers some european community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks and as a result doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have delegates said under the new rules the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas using price differentials to reflect different qualities non icco member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock london cocoa prices traded today around 1 300 stg per tonne down from around 1 450 stg in january 1987 and 1 750 stg in january 1986 a cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it according to the agreement the withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1 600 sdr lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled or if the buffer stock runs low on funds it says the icco will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on june 9 12

year and said the prospects for the 1987 cane sugar crop also are good dave carter president of the u s beet sugar association said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states california and michigan while sowings could be down slightly in the largest producing state of minnesota overall carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the midwest and this coupled with increases in california would increase u s sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1 232 mln acres sown last year usda later today releases its first estimate of 1987 u s sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report the main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and grains are just awful said carter in the midwest bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to plant sugarbeets because the u s sugar program offers a loan rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season said luther markwart executive vice president of the american sugarbeet growers association the banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys markwart said in some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a contract with processors to plant beets markwart said usda s report today will not include any harvested area estimates for sugarcane but representatives of florida hawaii and louisiana growers said crop prospects are good horis godfrey a consultant representing florida and texas cane growers said florida cane is off to a good start because for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year cane production may be up in florida this year he said in hawaii area harvested may decline slightly this year but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields said eiler ravnholt vice president of the hawaiian sugar planters association the acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production threaten the u s sugar program industry sources said the increases in beet plantings have especially caused concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings particularly in hawaii industry officials said we haven t had a good weather year throughout the beet and cane areas in more than five years said godfrey adding that the u s may be due for a good weather year rep jerry huckaby d la chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee

stocks still stands andrea minguzzi an official at french sugar producer beghin say said last week beghin say president jean marc vernes said a possible settlement of a row with the ec would lead producers to withdraw their offer which was made as a protest against ec export licensing policies the ec policy is to offer export rebates which fail to give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get by offering sugar into intervention stocks vernes said but minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer already lodged with intervention boards of different european countries he said final quality approval for all the sugar offered could come later this week some 95 pct had already cleared quality specifications the ec can only reject an offer to sell into intervention stocks on quality grounds minguzzi added that under ec regulations the community has until early may to pay for the sugar he

may september temporao harvest in brazil s main cocoa growing state of bahia are now in the 1 5 mln to 2 0 mln 60 kilo bag range against 2 0 mln to 2 5 mln two weeks ago traders in the state capital salvador told reuters the effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had been harsher than thought earlier although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in mid february subsequent pod setting was dissappointing last year s temporao also hit by a dry spell was 2 77 mln bags in 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1 79 mln bags the traders said another factor leading to lower crop predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for plantations because of low returns on their investment manpower fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the past six months coupled with low bean prices if such economies continue into the winter months both the temporao and the developing october april main crop could face serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would normally be treated against the disease recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say these are not yet significant the traders said they expect very low deliveries of temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the bulk will not appear until the last month september despite the low loads trees are said to be in excellent condition and recent flowering and pod setting which will lead to late temporao early main crop beans has been good reuter u s cargo preference squabble continues 13 the u s agriculture department said it will begin charging interest tomorrow on the over 12 mln dlrs the department of transportation dot

percentage of food aid shipments carried on u s vessels was to increase gradually over three years to 75 pct in 1988 from 50 pct although the increased cost was to be funded by dot sims said that

malaysia declines to state position on cocoa pact 13 government officials in malaysia a major cocoa producer have declined to say whether it will join the international cocoa agreement icca for which buffer stock rules were agreed in london last week ministry of primary industries officials said in january the cabinet would decide on malaysia s participation but so far a decision has not been announced the government is said to be in favour of joining the pact but local cocoa growers and traders told reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage malaysia is the world s fourth largest cocoa producer the government feels that the pact through its buffer stock mechanism can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses officials said but growers and traders are concerned malaysia s participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non member countries of the icca they estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of malaysia s cocoa exports officially estimated at 112 000 tonnes in 1986 goes to non members most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump malaysia which produced 117 000 tonnes of cocoa last year might be forced to withhold up to 70 000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long term and this might affect their economic viability they said the cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs an industry source said the growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non members for the stockpile under the new rules purchases from non members such as malaysia will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon officials said but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date reuter u k intervention board details ec sugar

sugar sowings off to slow start 13 drilling of this year s british sugar beet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather conditions with only around one pct sown so far a spokesman for british sugar plc said this compares with two pct at the same stage last year three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984 there is little cause for concern with better weather forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted area of around 200 000 hectares in about 10 days seed beds look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures to rise the spokesman said if the crop can be drilled by the third week in april we will be delighted he said last year a large proportion of the crop was not drilled until may but it still turned out to be the equal second largest on record

tender was 46 864 ecus per 100 kilos up from 45 678 ecus the previous week london traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted the commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions the amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0 87 ecus per 100 kilos they said operators offered a total of 854 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low the sources said about 706 470 tonnes of french sugar and 79 000 tonnes of german sugar had been accepted the remainder being rejected as of too low quality the sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it they said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to

the market was switch and straddle bound in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries the undertone however remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to icco buffer stock buying dealers said the market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following new york s firmer close yesterday dealers said

recent fall in world sugar prices due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability has encouraged renewed buying interest from china and the soviet union london trade house e d and f man said further purchases are expected by the peoples republic of china at the lower end of the recent price range which should limit the downside movement it said in its latest monthly market report and it is believed that the soviet union will need to return to the market to take a further 250 000 350 000 tonnes for may june shipment man added the soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for april may shipment towards the end of last month which brings its total purchases to around 1 65 mln tonnes man said production estimates for the thai crop now exceed 2 3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2 5 mln tonnes however this upturn in the thai crop is being countered by a reduction in china s production forecast to 5 3 mln tonnes from 5 5 mln estimated earlier market participation by cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year s 7 3 mln tonnes but even with similar production man expects cuban exports to be significantly down cuba was reported to be carrying 1 3 mln tonnes of stocks in september 1985 of which some 440 000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985 86 exports to about 6 9 mln but as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year man estimates cuba s export availabilty will be reduced to 6 4 to 6 5 mln tonnes however cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability man said since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes but at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements a fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged but the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market man said the increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency as this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements man said commenting on the current row between the ec commission and sugar producers man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market unless there are further improvements at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention it added reuter beghin say not planning to withdraw sugar 13 french sugar producer beghin say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week s european community ec sugar tender beghin say president jean marc vernes told reuters the maximum rebate of 46 864 ecus per 100 kilos on wednesday was the largest ever granted according to traders vernes said he was satisfied the european commission has started to move in the right direction but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention but vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention european operators offered 854 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low over 785 000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on wednesday according to commission sources under ec regulations however operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it a total of 706 470 tonnes of french sugar and 79 000 tonnes of west german sugar has been accepted into intervention trade sources said here this amount represents about a third of annual ec exports to non ec countries beghin say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention but said it was below 500 000 tonnes producers say they have been losing 2 5 to 3 0 ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between ec and world prices wednesday s rebate was 0 87 ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention traders said vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said wednesday s tender was a step in the right direction sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates which are due to be adopted shortly may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future one source at a leading french sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got

price was 1 577 61 sdr per tonne yesterday months used currently for the indicator are may july and september but these are set to change to july september and december on april 15 prior to may becoming the new york spot month traders noted the introduction of december into the calculations may lift the daily sdr price as december is currently quoted about 75 stg above may on the london terminal market but the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10 day average the indicator which governs his activities traders said the buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75 000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts if purchases reach this level within six months buying is suspended pending an icco council review of price ranges but some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor brazilian bahia temporao crop at 1 5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln a lower than expected brazilian crop may cut the 1986 87 world surplus to between 50 000 and 70 000 tonnes compared with a recent forecast by the icco statistics committee of 94 000 tonnes traders said in these circumstances the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes to lift prices above the must buy level but some dealers said the icco buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market the buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non members could limit the buffer stock s scope for action dealers said most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in store material of malaysian and ivory coast origin but the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct malaysian cocoa as malaysia is not an icco member while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of malaysian material traders said buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as ghana will have only a limited impact on futures but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures ghana s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying dealers said the buffer stock may not help the terminal market but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas one trader said traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were all prognostication and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure in june the icco is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism reuter brazil seamen s strike ends 13 a brazilian seamen s strike which began on february 27 and has been tapering off for weeks has now

than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads townsend thoresen say the ship built at the west german yard of bremerhaven in 1980 was built to the highest safety standards but salvage expert william cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design former townsend thoresen navigating officer clive langley said the roro type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge as any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over an ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability he said cooper said cross channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level if you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship he added reuter brazil seamen continue strike after court decision 13 hundreds of marines were on alert at 11 key brazilian ports after 40 000 seamen decided to remain on

sugar beet area stable under the current five year plan 1985 89 and producing enough to cover only domestic demand despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3 58 mln tonnes from 4 07 mln in 1985 but a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet kept production at 454 000 tonnes with 30 000 extra refined in yugoslavia from hungarian beet output

cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2 0 mln to 2 5 mln bag range against 2 5 mln to 3 0 mln a fortnight ago trade sources told reuters from the state capital of salvador that despite scattered rains since mid february which broke a six week drought plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the may september crop the sources said arrivals from may through july might only reach around 600 000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1 0 mln to 1 5 mln bags might be expected arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered however the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid and which is more likely from late july on this year s crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot a severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500 000 bags in a very short period one source said because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2 0 mln bag mark if the disease hits although flowering was good following the start of the rains pod setting was not up to expectations possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers the sources said however reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good which should result in mature fruit from august through september the sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop which officially starts on october 1 the cut off date is completely artificial if things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from august through november or even december one said if predictions of a 2 0 to 2 5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2 7 mln bag average for the past 10 years the last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1 79 mln bags the lowest since 1974 good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3 12 mln bags just below the 1983 3 17 mln bag record while last year s output which also suffered some drought damage was 2 77 mln bags figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans the sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year s record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on april 30 recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared because of the high turnover of beans this year significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals with official arrivals figures for the 1986 87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6 1 mln bags and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year the total outturn should be at least a record 6 5 mln bags if all production is declared the sources said this would compare with the previous record set last year of 6 03 mln however there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the may 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986 87 harvest may never be officially registered reuter u s sugar imports down in week usda 13 sugar imports subject to the u s sugar import quota during the week ended january 9 the initial

demand for sweet drinks cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods it will not be easy to cut domestic demand even in a state controlled economy china may have to import he said customs figures show imports fell to 1 182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1 909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25 165 tonnes in january 1987 from 54 000 in january 1986 the official economic information newspaper last month said production in the 1986 87 crushing season september april will be 1 18 mln tonnes short of demand the paper put 1986 87 output at 4 82 mln down from 5 24 mln in 1985 86 and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes in the last two years acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen sugar mills are underutilised output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day it said the country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand it added it quoted the ministry of light industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them the paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane he could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs it said in fujian the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520 1 in 1980 cutting the mills profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217 9 it added the paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985 86 crushing season losing money china has 521 sugar mills a foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986 87 september august of up to 10 pct in guangdong which produced 45 pct of china s sugar in calendar 1985 and a smaller drop in fujian which produced 11 pct of china s sugar in calendar 1985 he said both provinces are more developed than other sugar producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities but cane acreage in guangxi and yunnan which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986 87 because cane growing is more economic there he said he put sugar stocks at 2 333 mln tonnes in september 1986 a hong kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end january now they are falling but they have not reached the critical level compelling china to import quickly he said china has options not easily available in western countries it controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly he said the hong kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986 because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which he said are likely to continue until at least end 1988 he said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state owned mills with a small amount sold raw to consumers most of the mills are old and inefficient with many of them using soviet equipment imported in the 1950s he said he said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct reuter japan shipbuilders seek cartel to restrict output 13

year against capacity of about six mln cgrt the transport ministry estimates new orders at 3 3 mln cgrt in the year to march 1988 and 3 1 mln the following year the industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977 78 under cartel or transport ministry guidelines the latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln cgrt in the year to march 31 the cartels self

13 european sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year despite recent firmness in world prices analysts and industry sources said a reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while so far european community ec growers plan unchanged to lower areas increases are expected in some eastern european nations trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 european beet plantings made last week by west german sugar statistician f o licht areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this in recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons changes in ec areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so called c sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market this is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the ec a and b quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the ec commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into ec intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high ec internal and low world market prices however with the ec budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic a and b quotas they added in france the largest producer of ec quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board firs said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year s 421 000 hectares nine pct below the previous year the basic trend is towards stability a firs spokesman said unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars white sugar french franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels he said beet sugar output last year was 3 37 mln tonnes with an average yield of 8 00 tonnes per ha the highest in the ec apart from the netherlands but below 8 52 the previous year and a five year average 8 11 in west germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few months ago industry sources said the farm ministry said a december survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average licht last week estimated west german plantings at a reduced 385 000 hectares against 399 000 last year british sugar plc the monopoly beet processor has signed up u k farmers to grow 8 1 mln tonnes of beet this should yield about 1 25 mln tonnes of whites last year s crop equalled the second highest ever at 1 32 mln tonnes british sugar has a and b quotas totalling 1 144 mln tonnes of whites and its c output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease resistant seed types recent price rises have not altered polish plans wincenty nowicki a deputy director of cukropol the amalgamated sugar industry enterprises said world prices are still below polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level the national plan set before prices began to rise put plantings this year at 460 000 hectares against 425 000 in 1986 nowicki said last year production was 1 74 mln tonnes world prices have less impact in italy than in france or germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market an official at the national beet growers association said italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year s 270 000 ha especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya beet output last season of 15 5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1 72 mln tonnes of white sugar dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130 000 ha from a record 137 600 in 1986 as a new self imposed quota system comes into force a spokesman for centrale suiker the second largest dutch sugar processor said the new system aims for an average of around 915 000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of c sugar last year the netherlands produced a record 1 2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined a and b quota of only 872 000 tonnes the world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of c sugar really worthwhile the spokesman said western agricultural experts in moscow said soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged licht put this year s soviet beet area at 3 40 mln ha against 3 44 mln last year hungary is expanding its beet area to 105 000 ha from some 95 000 in 1986 the official mti news agency said but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand the spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180 000 ha this year a spokesman for denmark s largest beet concern de danske sukkerfabrikker a s said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365 000 tonnes from a steady area of 60 000 ha in sweden where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand the planted area is seen little changed at 51 000 ha against 51 300 last year according to a spokesman for sugar company svenska sockerfabriks ab last year irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state run irish sugar plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36 400 hectares down from 37 600 in 1986 reuter cocoa latest focus for commodity pact negotiators 13 the credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market government delegates and trade experts said only two weeks ago world coffee prices slumped when international coffee organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated this week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work the still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the international tin council itc which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations the itc s failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built in flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade a more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new international natural rubber agreement in geneva at the weekend some importing countries insist the international cocoa organization icco buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought one consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the icco for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder on friday this uncertainty helped push london cocoa futures down to eight month lows the strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices the icco daily and average prices on friday fell below the must buy level of 1 600 sdrs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last icco session in january but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given the agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets a cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 000 tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade it has an upper limit of 250 000 tonnes the key arguments being faced by the icco working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa another working group is scheduled to meet wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on thursday producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non member countries such as malaysia consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium priced high quality cocoas the argument over buying non member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities european industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non member cocoa and that it use the london futures market s existing differentials for different qualities currently good west african cocoa is tendered at par onto the london market discounts which are currently under review range up to 50 stg a tonne for brazilian and malaysian cocoa consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower the january talks were slowed by a split inside the european community a key icco consumer group with france siding with producers ec representatives met in closed session in brussels on friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations the source said the ec will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there one icco delegate describing the producer consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not in contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers in either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers reuter brazilian bank workers decide on national strike 13 brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government s anti inflation plan at a rally in this city about 100 km northwest of sao paulo about 5 000 bank workers voted to strike on march 24 unless their

january meeting france sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate delegates said that meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules the ec commission met in brussels on friday to see whether the 12 ec cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month s meeting the commissioners came away from the friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues delegates said the key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide icco members are whether non member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa delegates said a consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non member cocoa question a working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning then broke up into a producer meeting and an ec meeting followed by a consumer meeting producers who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non member cocoa being accepted

should be implemented both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement they said i am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement maybe not tomorrow or the next day but some time later in the session a consumer delegate said producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of icco member cocoa comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades delegates said some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non member cocoa also and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance delegates said

employers organisation labour relations manager gerard zeebregts told reuters port and transport union spokesman bert duim said the employers decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector the strike action was called off on friday after an interim court injunction against the employers plans for 350 redundancies this year a court in amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on may 7 zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the may 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case we cannot afford not to continue with our plans the strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business and further delays would do even more damage zeebregts said the campaign of lightning strikes in the port s general cargo sector began on january 19 in protest at employers plans for 800 redundancies from the sector s 4 000 strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year reuter cocoa working group meeting delayed 13 the international cocoa organization icco buffer stock working group meeting set for 1130 gmt today was rescheduled for 1430 icco delegates

proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon delegates said the plan presented by icco executive director kobena erbynn represented a compromise between producer european community ec and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate they said the proposal involved three key principles first the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously delegates said under an offer system the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices they said the second provision was that non icco member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa to be set by a formula the delegates said after the plan was presented working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers ec consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 gmt producer delegates said consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from one consumer

negotiation base 13 icco members accept buffer stock principles 13 international cocoa organization icco producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation delegates said the buffer stock working group then asked icco executive director kobena erbynn who wrote up the draft compromise to flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a representative group of delegates they said the working group broke up for the day into a smaller group of five producers and five consumers to discuss administrative rules and into the group headed by erbynn to hammer out buffer stock rules details delegates said delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be ironed out whenever we start getting into details the clouds gather one delegate said erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early tomorrow delegates said the principles of the draft proposal included establishing an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted price system a limit to the amount of non icco member cocoa that can be bought and differentials to be paid for different varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock delegates said reuter ivory coast minister delayed for cocoa talks 13 ivorian agriculture minister denis bra

traders still cautious on icco 13 new york cocoa traders reacted with caution to today s developments at the international cocoa organization talks in london saying there is still time for negotiations to break down i would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point said jack ward president of the cocoa trading firm barretto peat if and when a final position comes out of the icco talks one will still have time to put on positions the risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain icco producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation a smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details market sentiment has reflected optimism i would t put it any stronger than that ward said it seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement but one shouldn t forget how much they have to negotiate said another trader of today s developments many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so traders said the dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms one trader said speculators have gone net long but only slightly so he added the recent price strength gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days has been due in large part to sterling s rally against the dollar and in

from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers industry sources told reuters the salvage measures which include a government sponsored rationalisation program are aimed at clawing back some of the market which japan the world leader has lost to south korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages they said the sources said south korea s yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than japan s due to such factors the government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before parliament this month and likely to be approved by may or june the sources said they said from september a semi government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment last friday the shipbuilders association of japan applied to the fair trade commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from april 1 the commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month the sources said a clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost cutting and streamlining program and state support should help japanese yards recover their international competitiveness they said under the cartel proposals 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10 000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes cgrt in 1987 88 this is about half of total capacity this will ease the cut throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost the sources said the industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988 89 as the transport ministry sees new orders falling to 3 1 mln cgrt in 1988 89 from 3 3 mln in 1987 88 they said the rationalisation program includes a cut of 20 000 to 30 000 of the estimated 100 000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989 japanese yards topped world order books at end december followed by south korea and taiwan according to lloyd s register of shipping however falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry the sources said four of japan s six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to march 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986 7 they said the shipbuilding companies streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with south korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years the sources said in japan no single yard leads the industry resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity the two largest firms mitsubishi heavy industries ltd lt mith t and ishikawajima harima heavy industries co ltd lt jima t account for only 30 pct of ships built the sources said world shipowners hope japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world said an official at a major japanese shipping company the japanese merchant fleet the largest after liberia s has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships and this will encourage japanese yards the sources said reuter sugar prices too low to boost latin output 13 latin american sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production official and trade sources said although prices have risen to around eight from five u s cents per lb in the past six months they are still below the region s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost the recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert manuel rico a consultant with the group of latin american and caribbean sugar exporting countries geplacea told reuters however rico said it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable he said officials in mexico guatemala and ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production but industry leaders in panama and costa rica said there was still a long way to go the prices are ridiculous said julian mateo vice president of costa rica s sugar cane industrial agricultural league at current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output given the instability of world markets an official at colombia s national association of sugar cane growers said they had no plans to raise export targets the market is very unstable what is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything in 1985 the latest year for which full figures are available central and south american nations produced 28 mln tonnes raw value of sugar of which 12 3 mln were exported a year earlier they had produced and exported about 800 000 more according to the london based international sugar organization years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover miguel guerrero director of the dominican republic s national sugar institute said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply output had slumped to under 450 000 tonnes a year from 900 000 in the late 1970s obsolete refineries poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output he added plans of nearby cuba the world s largest cane sugar exporter to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious trade sources said output is running well below the record 8 6 mln produced in 1970 cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to eastern bloc countries under special deals last year bad weather added to its troubles and output fell to 7 2 mln tonnes from 8 2 mln in 1985 the low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover u s and in the case of some caribbean countries european community ec import quotas for which they receive prices well above free market levels progressive reductions in the u s quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market peru for example shipped 96 000 tonnes to the u s in both 1983 and 1984 this fell to 76 000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37 000 a national cooperative official said that as long as world market levels continue at around half of peru s production cost the future of the industry is uncertain at a meeting of geplacea in brazil last october officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which according to the group s executive secretary eduardo latorre grows like a weed throughout the region brazil the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency the difference in the price the state run sugar and alcohol institute iaa pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year coupled with a drought reduced cane crop has meant brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987 trade sources said negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far the main sticking point being how brazil should compensate buyers for non delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year with the institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles however the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps sources within latin america and the caribbean hold little hope for the region s sugar industry to return to profitability unless the u s and ec change their policies the agricultural policies of the european community and of the united states have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries brazil s trade and industry minister jose hugo castelo branco told the october geplacea meeting the ec has come under prolonged attack from geplacea for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets geplacea officials say this is the main cause of low prices geplacea sees a new international sugar agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region s industry out of steady decline such an agreement would have to have both u s and ec backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact they have to realise that the more our economies suffer the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region s 360 billion dollar foreign debt geplacea s

a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker for the canadian coast guard transport minister john crosbie said in a vancouver address crosbie said versatile pacific shipyards inc was the low bidder to build the arctic class 8 icebreaker but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded the government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel said before the contract can be awarded versatile will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work crosibie said versatile s bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1 000 person years of direct employment work on the vessel which crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world would begin next year and completed in 1992 the government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the u s coast guard s vessel the polar sea through the disputed northwest passage the u s government did not seek permission for the journey claiming the area was an international water way the government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country s claim of sovereignty in the arctic reuter cuba tells traders sugar exports may be delayed 13 cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in march that these contracts will take second place to cuba s direct shipments to its export markets dealers here said some traders who have received telexes from cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the soviet union as the destination of their contracts the telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor cuban crop worry over brazil s export availability and increasing soviet demand analysts said traders said signs of cuba s shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind syria calling a snap buying tender last month normally syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery and last month s spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive march shipments as cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets traders said reuter czarnikow expects lower european sugar output 13 european sugar output on the basis of three year average yields will

put at around 7 5 mln tonnes raw value by broker c czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review allowing for around 700 000 tonnes for the current year s domestic usage it would leave around 6 8 mln tonnes for export of which czarnikow estimates about 3 7 mln tonnes will be taken by the ussr 1 530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non socialist bloc destinations czarnikow also estimated ussr 1986 87 production at 8 75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3 7 mln imports from cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14 2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1 75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity czarnikow said reuter u s cargo preference funding accord seen near 13 the u s departments of agriculture and transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on u s flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference melvin sims usda s general sales manager told a house agriculture appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a memorandum of understanding on cargo preference under a 1985 farm bill provision the percentage of food aid shipments carried on u s flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988 the increased cost of using u s vessels was to be funded by the transportation department instead of usda however usda officials said transportation has so far contributed no money the agreement between usda and transportation is expected to resolve the matter usda officials said tom kay administrator of the usda s foreign agricultural service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on u s vessels has been difficult to meet as the tonnage required under cargo preference goes up its going to be harder and harder to meet kay said two farm state congressmen pat roberts r kan and glenn english d okla said cargo preference makes u s farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated in the past farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the u s shipping fleet reuter ec sugar tender seen as concession to producers 13 the rebate granted at yesterday s ec sugar tender represents some concession to producers complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc ec commission officials said the maximum rebate of 44 819 european currency units ecus per 100 kilos was 1 3 ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention the rebate at last week s tender was 2 5 ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed the officials said the officials said the commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854 000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates they said the french and german producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before april 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores payment for it is due five weeks later and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between april 1 and the official payment date when the commission officially takes ownership of the sugar the officials said the officials said if the commission has to buy the sugar it is determined to immediately resell it a move which would drive down market prices further they expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales we think they realise they have gone too far one official said reuter cocoa delegates optimistic on buffer stock rules 13 hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an international cocoa organization icco council meeting which opened here today delegates said both producer and consumer icco members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving the chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman mama mohammed told journalists consumer spokesman peter baron called the tone of the negotiations optimistic and realistic the icco council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new international cocoa agreement came into force in january with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time the existing buffer stock of about 100 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs the icco made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations the council broke for lunch and reconvenes at 1500 hrs a working group which has been meeting since monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs when icco executive director kobena erbynn presents a fleshed out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week delegates said mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by erbynn and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme the draft proposal included three principles a limit to non member cocoa comprising the buffer stock an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock delegates said during the morning council session the ivory coast delegation gave an open minded statement that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible baron said ivorian agriculture minister denis bra kanon chairman of the icco council was now expected to arrive in london monday to attend the talks baron said vice chairman sir denis henry of grenada

afternoon delegates said reuter accord said in sight in brazil seamen s strike 13 an accord is in sight in brazil s 20 day old national seamen s strike which has seriously delayed exports a union official said the official speaking from strike headquarters in rio de janeiro said up to 30 000 of brazil s 40 000 seamen were still on strike he said the others had returned to work over the last week accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and from the frota nacional de petroleiros fronape part of the state owned oil company petrobras the association grouping private shipowners syndarma has also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over payment for overtime the union official said he believed this issue would be resolved shortly reuter panama canal official confirms no 1988 toll rise 13 panama canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end september 1988 despite last october s landslide which dumped 0 5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway canal commission administrator dennis mcauliffe said he told a press conference that in confirming the commission s earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988 he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989 the canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year s revenues this year s deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs mcauliffe said this included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth moving operations to prevent any further landslides he said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal s water supply in the foreseeable future studies concerning the possibility of widening the gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide he said adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by january 1988 at the latest reuter ec may offer intervention sugar to local market 13 sugar which ec producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the european commission for sale within the community broker c czarnikow says in its latest sugar review the commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0 01 european currency unit ecu to the intervention price with detrimental consequences for producers returns czarnikow says the move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar the commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course such as removing the time limit on storage contracts which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of september czarnikow says there is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced if the commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders czarnikow notes to match the difference between the ec price and the world market price the extra costs might be as much as 20 ecus per tonne it says the producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy czarnikow says but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under ec rules the primary cause of the plan to sell 775 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in france is dissatisfaction with the ec export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the ec price and the world market price czarnikow notes the french move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the commission s hand in west germany 79 250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention but czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986 87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986 in addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price west german producers face a further price reduction in july with a probable revaluation of the green mark even if the immediate crisis is resolved the problem is not expected to disappear permanently it has appeared to traders for some years that the ec s export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand it says the weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded czarnikow says suggesting that the commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of unnecessary bureaucracy surrounding the export tender system reuter icco to examine buffer stock details tomorrow 13 the international cocoa council icco adjourned for the day after a detailed proposal on buffer stock rules was distributed and executive

sugar agreement isa with economic clauses he said ricart currently the dominican republic s ambassador to austria the netherlands and the un in geneva said he will visit the four major exporters

international sugar pact to be renegotiated 13 the international sugar agreement isa will be renegotiated international sugar organization iso officer in charge constantin politoff told reuters after a special session of the pact s council a decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the iso six monthly session in may the alternatives are between an autumn london conference for another pact without economic clauses but a different voting and budgetary structure or a geneva based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses he said but delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world s four major exporters australia brazil cuba and the european community can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world today s special session was called because the u s earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the iso budget at today s council session politoff said the u s would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50 000 stg later this year currently about three quarters of this year s iso 800 000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the u s caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact the soviet union has called for changes to the way the iso budget is shared out currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the soviet union has a 30 pct share of the importer half the soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share

chinese port underused despite congestion nearby 13 the chinese port of ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from shanghai which is seriously congested a port official

ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south china and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from brazil and australia the docks can handle ships of up to 150 000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200 000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour most of ningbo s port infrastructure has been built since 1979 official publications show a container berth

of tension in the gulf and said iran would continue to use all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension weinberger said in a television interview in the u s we are fully prepared to do what s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway we aren t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area he said weinberger said u s warship movements in the gulf area were

vernes said that the protest involving 770 000 tonnes of sugar from french producers alone was prompted by the ec s policy since mid 1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into ec intervention at last week s tender the ec commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1 3 european currency units ecus per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed compared with the previous week s rebate which was 2 5 ecus below the necessary level vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the ec would take but he reaffirmed the long term desire of producers to export to the world market providing they were not losing money by doing so producers can withdraw their intervention offer after april 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date the ec has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers reuter iranian tanker attacked over weekend lloyds 13 the iranian steam tanker avaj 316 379

closer delegates say 13 the international cocoa organization icco moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by friday everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation monday a consumer delegate said the atmosphere is excellent other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by monday but could be in place by around april 1 if the rules are agreed by friday a detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon a big step toward a very interesting stage of negotiations delegates said the package based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates has been forged bit by bit during fortnight long meetings by icco executive director kobena erbynn and a small group of other delegates producers the european community ec and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow under the proposal the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system he would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired delegates said the manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before giving preference to icco member country exporters standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin similar to golf handicaps to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins they said the differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager the delegates said revision would be decided by a majority vote of the icco council buffer stock purchases from non icco member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock they said the purchases would be limited to 5 000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20 000 tonnes per week and could be bought in nearby intermediate and forward positions they added one of the underlying ideas of the rules package is transparency meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible delegates said after the tin market collapse in 1985 when the international tin council buffer stock ran out of funds cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism they said earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching friday deadline when the icco meeting is due to adjourn delegates said the icco failed to agree buffer stock rules in january when the new international cocoa agreement came into force the existing buffer stock of 100 000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs both untouchable until rules are agreed though the current semi annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules producers are keen to get the wheels

soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987 jerry huckaby a leading congressman representing sugar growers told reuters in an interview huckaby a louisiana democrat and chairman of the house subcommittee which deals with the sugar program indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in u s sugar imports this year with imports coming down from 1 8 mln last year to one mln there is legitimate concern about the impacts on caribbean countries and the philippines huckaby said by bringing forward to the third quarter some imports the quota would effectively be eased by about 250 000 tons huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the september to december period we could get away without having to increase the quota he noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified earlier this month representatives of u s cane sugar refiners met with u s agriculture department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200 000 tons the refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the u s later this year a refiner spokesman said however the official slaid the usda replied only that it would consider the request following the refiners request representatives of the florida sugarcane producers met with usda to express opposition to any quota expansion industry sources said the statement by huckaby who as a representative from a sugar growing district in louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota industry officials said any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the reagan administration s interagency sugar policy group asked about possible quota changes a usda official said as far as i know changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration reuter japan s

sugar from april 1 senior officials of the food and cooperatives ministry and the department told reuters they said the decision was taken after the sugar importers association asked that the sugar

man sugar ltd under which e d f man will hold a buffer stock on the government s behalf of 20 000 tonnes against the 45 000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the department officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks the agreement with e d f man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms they said four months ago the department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance the department and the private sector each imported around 115 000 tonnes of sugar last year when national consumption was 280 000 tonnes an importers association official said that even if the department no longer imports sugar we would not necessarily buy more this is because the association would still have to compete with the cooperatives wholesale establishment cwe he said the cwe is a semi government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it starting april 1 ministry officials said the cwe can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by e d f for the past two years

european operator threats to move over 800 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention they said that due to the dispute between the commission and producers over the issue it is not clear whether the

a rebate level of 45 75 to 46 0 ecus london traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the on going dispute between the commission and

broadcasting corp quoted mousavi as saying that tehran officially announced after its forces overran southern iraq s faw peninsula in february last year that it had shore to sea missiles the fact that the americans after so much delay are now thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because reagan needs this sensation now said mousavi speaking after a cabinet meeting in tehran we also

technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday the buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time they said delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock and the fixed price differentials at which

the six week old dispute in rotterdam s general cargo sector but neither side is optimistic spokesmen for both sides told reuters little progress was made in last night s three hours of talks with both sides largely reiterating their positions there is still a very large gap between the employers and the fnv and i can t say that we expect to reach any agreement but at least we are still talking a union spokesman said employers organization chairman jacques schoufour accused the fnv of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months the fnv is not serious about our discussions and i am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all if we find this afternoon that the fnv still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month schoufour said the series of strikes which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks began on january 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector s 4 000 workforce starting with 350 this year late last month social affairs minister

a further concession to producers complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc trade sources said they said the maximum rebate of 45 678 european currency units ecus per 100 kilos was 0 87 ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention the rebate at last week s tender was 1 3 ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2 5 ecus below this level but the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the commission that they intend to withdraw these offers the french and german operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after april 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores the five week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it ec officials have said that if the commission has to buy the sugar it is determined immediately to resell it a move which could drive down market prices further reuter madagascar cocoa production estimated higher 13 madagascar s cocoa production is estimated 13 pct higher this year at 2 720 tonnes up from 2 400 in 1986 agriculture ministry officials said this improvement reflects the government s efforts over the last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant new higher yielding varieties particularly at the northern tip of the

stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning delegates said bra kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences mostly on the issues of how much non member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow some consuming member nations including britain and belgium favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non member cocoa delegates have said the consumers argue that buying cheaper lower quality non member cocoas particularly malaysian will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market producers meanwhile say non member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer they say malaysia should not be able to benefit from the icco unless it is a member and if the buffer stock bought malaysian cocoa malaysia would have no incentive to join delegates said as to differentials ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock producer delegates said some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a
